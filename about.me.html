        Born and raised in Central New York, It was an ideal day for me to spend <br> 
    my time outdoors enjoying the constant changing of the world around me. Growing up in CNY <br>
    helped me to develop a strong appreciation for the changing of seasons, <br> 
    the critters that venture out of hiding at dusk and dawn, <br>
    and the unique weather patterns.<br>
        Throught my time in school I often caught myself daydreaming and doodling, always curious of <br> 
    what the world was like outside of what I knew. I constantly craved learning and experince; often what was <br>
    not provided in my traditional public school. I worked hard. I pursued my interest and appreciation of the world<br>
    through Art meanwhile keeping my grades up in hopes that one day I could shape my interests into a career as well. <br>
    Currently I am first year at SUNY New Paltz majoring in Visual Arts and planning to get a BFA in Painting!<br>
        Art is truly my passion, I hope I can utilize my dedication to it to help me live life to the fullest! <br>
